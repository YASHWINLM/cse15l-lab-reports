* Small change?

There is a small change that I could make to fix the incorrect output. This is because the error is with the inclusion of the parentheses, which could be fixed by modifying the way that our check for closed parentheses work, which would be less than 10 lines.

* Small change?
I don't think there is a small change that I could mak in order to fix this error. The index out of bounds exception indeicates that one of my for loops is written incorrectly which means that I would likely have to scrap and rewrite it so that change would be over 10 lines of code.
